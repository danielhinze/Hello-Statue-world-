Everything that the collector needs to know about statues. 
When a statue arrives broken what do you normally do, you request either a refund from the seller, or a partial refund in doing so, if you dont know the buyer there can be alot of conflict, in getting a full refund and the seller is very reluctant to be losing out on his product and also his money on top of the transaction. There is mainly three ways that people go about this with excuses. 

1. They say that is not there fault, as there was mint pictures shown before the statue was shipped. 
2. They refuse point blank to give a refund. 
3. They do issue a refund. 

Main thing to ask, is it the sellers fault when a Product comes broken and quiet simply yes it is no one pays for a broken statue/ unless it was broken to begin with.
